- Sorting:
    * Adaptive - Already sorted data takes less time
    * In-place - Doesn't require extra space
    * Stable - Two elements have the same value, a stable sorting algorithm keeps them in the same relative order as they were in the input.

- Selection sort:
    * Not stable. But, can be made.
    * In place
    * Not adaptive

- Insertion sort:
    * Adaptive
    * Stable
    * In place
    * Used when no. of elements is small

- Bubble sort:
    * In place
    * Stable
    * Not adaptive. But, can be made using boolean flag.
    * Total n-1 iterations. In ith iteration there will be n-1-i swaps.

- Quick sort:
    * Picks an element as pivot & partition around the pivot such that pivot element will be at correct position.
    * Not stable
    * Not adaptive
    * In place

- Merge sort:
    * Stable
    * Not adaptive
    * Not in-place (As it requires extra space for storing temp array)

- Counting sort:
    * TC - O(n+k), where k = max(arr), n = len(arr)
    * SC - O(k)
    * Not stable, Not adaptive, Not in-place
